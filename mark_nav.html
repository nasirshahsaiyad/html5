                <p><mark>The Himalaya</mark> is the highest and youngest mountain range in the world, stretching across
                    five countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. Formed millions of years ago by the
                    collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Himalaya continues to rise slowly each
                    year due to ongoing geological activity. This majestic range is home to some of the world's tallest
                    peaks, including Mount Everest, which stands at <mark>8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)</mark>, making
                    it the
                    highest point on Earth. The Himalaya plays a crucial role in regulating the climate of the Indian
                    subcontinent, acting as a barrier that blocks cold winds from Central Asia, which helps create the
                    monsoon season. Numerous rivers, such as the Ganges, Yamuna, Indus, and Brahmaputra, originate from
                    its glaciers, providing water to millions of people. The region is rich in biodiversity, with rare
                    species such as the snow leopard, red panda, and Himalayan monal thriving in its forests and alpine
                    meadows. Additionally, the Himalaya holds deep cultural and spiritual significance, being home to
                    ancient monasteries, temples, and sacred pilgrimage sites like Kedarnath, Badrinath, and Mount
                    Kailash. The range attracts adventurers and trekkers from around the world, offering famous trekking
                    routes such as the Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Circuit, and Manaslu Trek. Overall, the Himalaya is
                    not only a natural wonder but also a lifeline for the millions who depend on its resources for
                    survival.
